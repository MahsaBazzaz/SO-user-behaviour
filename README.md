# SO-user-behaviour
in this project:
1. I obtained the stackoverflow questions for a given tag within a given time period
2. I extracted for each post 5 important metrics
3. I generated a csv file with one line per question, where each line contains an identifier for a question and the values for the 5 chosen metrics

# Metrics
I extracted 5 important metrics for each question:
- if the question has accepted answer
- number of questions that link to the question
- the question view count
- the question answer count
- owner reputation
