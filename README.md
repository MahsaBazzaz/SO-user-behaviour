# SO-user-behaviour
in this project:
1. I obtained the stackoverflow posts for a given tag within a given time period
2. I extracted for each post 5 important metrics
3. I generated a csv file with one line per post, where each line contains an identifier for a post and the values for the 5 chosen metrics

# Metrics
I extracted 5 important metrics for each question:
- if the question has accepted answer
- the score of the question
- the question comments count
- the question answer count
- owner reputation
